Note that this server allows bots to use 'null' clues.
See http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/869065/can-you-tell-someone-they-have-0-cards-value-or-co
which states the designer allows null clues.

AwwBot is based on the scheme noted in
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1384616/aww-strategy-those-who-dont-fear-convention
There are various ways to finesse LH1 in this bot.

MawwBot is a version of AwwBot that only plays "very difficult" mode (mulitcolor).

SobBot is based on MawwBot (only very difficult supported).
Instead of the Aww rules, this bot uses colors to indicate a single play. It uses number clues to
indicate not only a play for the clued player but also that the next player's newest card is playable.
This can also be combined with finesse rule to get 3 cards played directly with 1 clue.
