Note that this server allows bots to use 'null' clues.
See http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/869065/can-you-tell-someone-they-have-0-cards-value-or-co
which states the designer allows null clues.

AwwBot is based on the scheme noted in
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1384616/aww-strategy-those-who-dont-fear-convention
There are various ways to finesse LH1 in this bot.

MawwBot is a version of AwwBot that only plays "very difficult" mode (mulitcolor).

SobBot is based on MawwBot (only very difficult supported).
Instead of the Aww rules, this bot uses colors to indicate a single play. It uses number clues to
indicate not only a play for the clued player but also that the next player's newest card is playable.
This can also be combined with finesse rule to get 3 cards played directly with 1 clue.

ModBot is based on an idea from http://boardgamegeek.com/article/19494563#19494563 which
uses modulo math to clue ALL players (except the clue giver) something about their hand with
each clue. This clues so efficiently, it overwhelms the game in all but the worst of deals with
4P or 5P. The algorithm could be improved to prevent some issues (see 
./run_ModBot --mode verydiff --players 4 --seed 1177368001
for a rare example.)
